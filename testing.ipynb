       "{'item1a': 'ITEM 1A - Risk Factors Our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Any of the risks described below could materially, adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Business and Industry Risks  The categories in which we participate are very competitive, and if we arenot able to compete effectively, our results of operations could be adverselyaffected. The human and pet food categories in which we participate are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers, as well as retailers with their own branded and private label products. Competitors market and sell their products through brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce. All of our principal competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition in our product categories is based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. If our large competitors were to seek an advantage through pricing or promotional changes, we could choose to do the same, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability. If we did not do the same, our revenues and market share could be adversely affected. Our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors. If we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality, we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private label products.  We may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment. There has been significant consolidation in the grocery industry, resulting in customers with increased purchasing power. In addition, large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased reliance on their own brand name products, increased emphasis on generic and other economy brands, and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation, knowledge of consumers’ needs, and category leadership positions to respond to these demands, our profitability and volume growth could be negatively impacted. In addition, the loss of any large customer could adversely affect our sales and profits. In fiscal 2023, Walmart accounted for 21 percent of our consolidated net sales and 28 percent of net sales of our North America Retail segment. For more information on significant customers, please see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.  Price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials, packaging,and energy may adversely affect our profitability. The principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather, climate change, product scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, trade tariffs, pandemics, war (including international sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine), and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. Commodity prices have become, and may continue to be, more volatile. Commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material, packaging, energy, and transportation costs. If we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices, we may experience reduced margins and profitability. We do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend.      9 Concerns with the safety and quality of our products could cause consumers toavoid certain products or ingredients. We could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain of our products or ingredients. Adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends,which may result in decreased demand for our products. Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes, eating habits, and purchasing behaviors of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences in channels where they shop. Consumer preferences and category-level consumption may change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends and other factors. If we fail to anticipate, identify or react to these changes and trends, such as adapting to emerging e-commerce channels, or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, we may experience reduced demand for our products, which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer. Similarly, demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium, trans fats, genetically modified organisms, sugar, processed wheat, grain-free or legume-rich pet food, or other product ingredients or attributes.  We may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in fastergrowing and more profitable categories. The food industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth. Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve. One way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories. Our future results will also depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories. If we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories, our growth and profitability could be adversely affected. Our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands. Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our many iconic brands is critical to the success of our business. The value of our brands is based in large part on the degree to which consumers react and respond positively to these brands. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products, our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, concerns about food safety, or our products becoming unavailable to consumers. Consumer demand for our products may also be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional support. The use of social and digital media by consumers, us, and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our business results could be negatively impacted. Operating Risks If we are not efficient in our production, our profitability could suffer as aresult of the highly competitive environment in which we operate. Our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets. Gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time. Our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions or divestitures could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position. Many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturing facilities and production lines. Such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production, which may negatively impact product volume and margins. We periodically engage in restructuring and cost savings initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and reduce expenses. If we are unable to execute those initiatives as planned, we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business. Our ability to make, move, and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, climate change, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, cyber-attack, pandemics, war, governmental restrictions or mandates, labor shortages, strikes, import/export restrictions, or other factors could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Many of our product lines are manufactured at a single location or sourced from a single supplier. The failure of third parties on which we rely, including those third parties who supply our ingredients, packaging, capital equipment and other necessary operating materials, contract manufacturers, commercial transport, distributors, contractors, and           10 external business partners, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, may negatively impact our operations. Our suppliers’ policies and practices can damage our reputation and the quality and safety of our products. Disputes with significant suppliers, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our sales, financial condition, and results of operations. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single location or supplier, could adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.  Short term or sustained increases in consumer demand at our retail customers may exceed our production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain. Our failure to meet the demand for our products could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  Our international operations are subject to political and economic risks. In fiscal 2023, 19 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the United States. We are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally, any of which could significantly harm our business. These risks include:  ●political and economic instability; ●exchange controls and currency exchange rates; ●tariffs on products and ingredients that we import and export; ●nationalization or government control of operations; ●compliance with anti-corruption regulations; ●foreign tax treaties and policies; and ●restriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences.  Our financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These fluctuations could cause material variations in our results of operations. Our principal exposures are to the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, and Swiss franc. From time to time, we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations, but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure.  A strengthening in the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in the countries in which we operate would negatively affect our reported results of operations and financial results due to currency translation losses and currency transaction losses. Our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are breached. Information technology serves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business. We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic information to manage a variety of business processes and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. Our information technology systems and infrastructure are critical to effectively manage our key business processes including digital marketing, order entry and fulfillment, supply chain management, finance, administration, and other business processes. These technologies enable internal and external communication among our locations, employees, suppliers, customers, and others and include the receipt and storage of personal information about our employees, consumers, and proprietary business information. Our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, may be vulnerable to damage, interruption, or shutdown due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events, natural disasters, fires, power outages, systems failures, telecommunications failures, security breaches, computer viruses, hackers, employee error or malfeasance, and other causes. Increased cyber-security threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems, as well as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored on those systems. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, data loss, legal claims or proceedings, regulatory penalties, and the loss of sales and customers. Any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational, reputational, legal, and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business. Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results. From time to time, we evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate acquired and existing operations. If we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions, our financial results could suffer. Additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include additional debt leverage, the loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business, the assumption of unknown liabilities, the inherent risk associated with entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience, failure to achieve anticipated synergies, and the impairment of goodwill or other acquisition-related intangible assets.       11 Legal and Regulatory Risks If our products become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled, we mightneed to recall those items and may experience product liability claims ifconsumers or their pets are injured. We may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. A significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands. New regulations or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect our business. Our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to the production, packaging, labelling, storage, distribution, quality, and safety of food products and the health and safety of our employees. Our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and recalls of our products. We advertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations. We may also be subject to new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise our products, including restrictions on the audience to whom products are marketed. Changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected.  We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies. We are currently party to a variety of environmental remediation obligations. Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation, and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current and former properties of ours, the potential exists for remediation, liability, indemnification, and compliance costs to differ from our estimates. We cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters, or compliance with environmental laws in general, will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Climate change and other sustainability matters could adversely affect our business. There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the earth’s atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. If such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may experience decreased availability and higher pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products. Increased frequency or severity of extreme weather could also impair our production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain, impact demand for our products, and increase our insurance and other operating costs. Increasing concern over climate change or other sustainability issues also may adversely impact demand for our products due to changes in consumer preferences or negative consumer reaction to our commitments and actions to address these issues. We may also become subject to additional legal and regulatory requirements relating to climate change or other sustainability issues, including greenhouse gas emission regulations (e.g., carbon taxes), energy policies, sustainability initiatives (e.g., single-use plastic limits), and disclosure obligations. If additional legal and regulatory requirements are enacted and are more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to reduce our emissions and improve our energy efficiency and other sustainability goals, or if we chose to take actions to achieve more aggressive goals, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operations. We have announced goals and commitments to reduce our carbon footprint. If we fail to achieve or improperly report on our progress toward achieving our carbon emissions reduction goals and commitments, then the resulting negative publicity could harm our reputation and adversely affect demand for our products. Financial and Economic Risks Volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices may cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings. We utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils (principally soybean), dairy products, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently, which may result in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings. These gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and in unallocated corporate items outside our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process, at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating           12 profit. We also record our grain inventories at net realizable value. We may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments. Economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products. The willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions. In periods of economic uncertainty, consumers may purchase more generic, private label, and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether. In those circumstances, we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings. In addition, as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions, we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins. Consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that purchase products from our North America Foodservice segment. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adversely affect our ability to pay dividends. As of May 28, 2023, we had total debt and noncontrolling interests of $12.0 billion. The agreements under which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future. Our level of indebtedness may limit our:  ●ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate purposes, particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; and ●flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions.  There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness, and other unrelated indebtedness, could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adversely affected.  Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, and other factors beyond our control. We depend on stable, liquid and well-functioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations. Our financial performance, our credit ratings, interest rates, the stability of financial institutions with which we partner, and the liquidity of the overall global capital markets could affect our access to, and the availability, terms and conditions, and cost of capital.  Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefitpension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit costs. We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the United States, Canada, and various foreign locations, including defined benefit pension, retiree health and welfare, severance, and other postemployment plans. Our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates, investment returns, and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations.  A change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth. As of May 28, 2023, we had $21. 2 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We compare the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. If current expectations for growth rates for sales and profits are not met, or other market factors and macroeconomic conditions were to change, then our reporting units could become significantly impaired. While we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired, different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses.       13  We evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets, primarily intangible assets associated with the Blue Buffalo,Pillsbury, Totino’s, Old El Paso, Progresso, Annie’s, Nudges,and Häagen-Dazs brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.  Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. If current expectations for growth rates for sales and margins are not met, or other market factors and macroeconomic conditions were to change, then our indefinite-lived intangible assets could become significantly impaired. Our Progresso, EPIC, and Uncle Toby’s brands had risk of decreasing coverage and we continue to monitor these businesses.  For further information on goodwill and intangible assets, please refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. ',\n",
       " 'item7': 'ITEM 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW We are a global packaged foods company. We develop distinctive value-added food products and market them under unique brand names. We work continuously to improve our core products and to create new products that meet consumers’ evolving needs and preferences. In addition, we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer-directed marketing, innovative new products, and effective merchandising. We believe our brand-building approach is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe. Our fundamental financial goal is to generate competitively differentiated returns for our shareholders over the long term. We believe achieving that goal requires us to generate a consistent balance of net sales growth, margin expansion, cash conversion, and cash return to shareholders over time. Our long-term growth objectives are to deliver the following performance on average over time: ●2 to 3 percent annual growth in organic net sales; ●mid-single-digit annual growth in adjusted operating profit; ●mid- to high-single-digit annual growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS); ●free cash flow conversion of at least 95 percent of adjusted net earnings after tax; and ●cash return to shareholders of 80 to 90 percent of free cash flow, including an attractive dividend yield. We are executing our Accelerate strategy to drive sustainable, profitable growth and top-tier shareholder returns over the long term. The strategy focuses on four pillars to create competitive advantages and win: boldly building brands, relentlessly innovating, unleashing our scale, and being a force for good. We are prioritizing our core markets, global platforms, and local gem brands that have the best prospects for profitable growth, and we are committed to reshaping our portfolio with strategic acquisitions and divestitures to further enhance our growth profile. In fiscal 2023, we continued to successfully adapt to the dynamic operating environment and deliver strong performance. This included growth in organic net sales, adjusted operating profit, and adjusted diluted EPS that was ahead of our initial targets. We achieved each of the three priorities we established at the beginning of the year: We continued to compete effectively, including holding or growing market share in more than 50 percent of our global priority businesses for the fifth consecutive year, when adjusting for an unusual competitive dynamic in cereal in fiscal 2022 and assessing that platform on a 2-year basis. We generated organic net sales growth across each of our four operating segments, fueled by compelling brand building and innovation across our leading brands, and supported with strong levels of net price realization in response to 13 percent input cost inflation. We continued to invest for the future, including a 17 percent increase in media and advertising expense, a double-digit increase in investment in our digital and technology capability, and a strong increase in capital investment related to new growth capacity. We continued to reshape our portfolio, including closing on one acquisition and two divestitures that further improved our portfolio’s ability to generate profitable growth over the long term. Our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2023 rose 6 percent to $20,094 million. On an organic basis, net sales increased 10 percent compared to year-ago levels. Operating profit of $3,434 million was down 1 percent. Adjusted operating profit of $3,457 million increased 8 percent on a constant-currency basis. Diluted EPS of $4.31 was down 2 percent compared to fiscal 2022 results. Adjusted diluted EPS of $4.30 increased 10 percent on a constant-currency basis (See the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)). Net cash provided by operations totaled $2,779 million in fiscal 2023, representing a conversion rate of 106 percent of net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. This cash generation supported capital investments totaling $690 million, and our resulting free cash flow was $2,089 million at a conversion rate of 80 percent of adjusted net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. We returned cash to shareholders through dividends totaling $1,288 million and net share repurchases totaling $1,171 million. (See the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). A detailed review of our fiscal 2023 performance compared to fiscal 2022 appears below in the section titled “Fiscal 2023 Consolidated Results of Operations.” A detailed review of our fiscal 2022 performance compared to our fiscal 2021 performance is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 30, 2022 under the caption “Management’s Discussion and                                                        16 Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Fiscal 2022 Results of Consolidated Operations,” which is incorporated herein by reference. In fiscal 202 4, we expect to build on our positive momentum and continue to advance our Accelerate strategy. Our key priorities are to continue to compete effectively, to improve our supply chain efficiency, and to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation. We expect the largest factors impacting our performance in fiscal 2024 will be the economic health of consumers, the moderating rate of input cost inflation, and the increasing stability of the supply chain environment. We expect to drive organic net sales growth in fiscal 2024 through strong marketing, innovation, in-store support, and net price realization generated through our Strategic Revenue Management (SRM) capability, most of which will be carried over from SRM actions taken in fiscal 2023. For the full year, input cost inflation is expected to be approximately 5 percent of total cost of goods sold, driven primarily by labor inflation that continues to impact sourcing, manufacturing, and logistics costs. We expect to generate higher levels of Holistic Margin Management (HMM) cost savings compared to fiscal 2023. Based on these assumptions, our key full-year fiscal 2024 targets are summarized below: ●Organic net sales are expected to increase 3 to 4 percent. ●Adjusted operating profit is expected to increase 4 to 6 percent in constant-currency from the base of $3,457 million reported in fiscal 2023. ●Adjusted diluted EPS are expected to range between 4 to 6 percent in constant-currency from the base of $4.30 earned in fiscal 2023. ●Free cash flow conversion is expected to be at least 95 percent of adjusted after-tax earnings. See the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP. Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this report. FISCAL 2023 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In fiscal 2023, net sales increased 6 percent compared to fiscal 2022 and organic net sales increased 10 percent compared to last year. Operating profit decreased 1 percent to $3,434 million primarily driven by higher input costs, a decrease in contributions from volume growth, an unfavorable change to the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodities positions and grain inventories, and an increase in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses, including increased media and advertising expenses, partially offset by favorable net price realization and mix. Operating profit margin of 17.1 percent decreased 120 basis points. Adjusted operating profit of $3, 457 million increased 8 percent on a constant-currency basis, primarily driven by favorable net price realization and mix, partially offset by higher input costs, a decrease in contributions from volume growth and an increase in SG&A expenses, including increased media and advertising expenses. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 30 basis points to 17.2 percent. Diluted earnings per share of $4.31 decreased 2 percent compared to fiscal 2022. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.30 increased 10 percent on a constant-currency basis (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).

Cost of sales increased $958 million in fiscal 2023 to $13,548 million. The increase was primarily driven by a $1,454 million increase attributable to product rate and mix, partially offset by a $950 million decrease due to lower volume. We recorded a $292 million net increase in cost of sales related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories in fiscal 2023, compared to a net decrease of $133 million in fiscal 2022 (please see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information). In fiscal 2023, we recorded a $25 million charge related to a voluntary recall on certain international Häagen-Dazs ice cream products. We also recorded $5 million of restructuring charges and $2 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2023 compared to $3 million of restructuring charges in cost of sales in fiscal 2022 (please see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information). Gross margin increased 2 percent in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. Gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased 110 basis points to 32.6 percent compared to fiscal 2022. SG&A expenses increased $353 million to $3,500 million in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily driven by increased media and advertising expenses, unfavorable valuation adjustments and the loss on sale of certain corporate investments, an increase in certain compensation and benefits expenses, and an increase in charitable contributions in fiscal 2023. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales in fiscal 2023 increased 80 basis points compared to fiscal 2022. Divestitures gain, net totaled $445 million in fiscal 2023primarily related to the sale of our Helper main meals and Suddenly Salad side dishes business. In fiscal 2022, we recorded a $194 million divestitures gain related to the sale of our interest in Yoplait SAS, Yoplait marques SNC and Liberté Marques Sàrl and our European dough businesses (please refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report).Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs (recoveries) totaled $56 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $26 million of net recoveries in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2023, we approved restructuring actions to enhance the efficiency of our global supply chain structure and to optimize our Häagen-Dazs shops network, and as a result, we recorded $41 million of charges in fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2022, we approved restructuring actions in the International segment to drive efficiencies in manufacturing and logistics operations and recorded $12 million of charges. Please see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information.                                       18 Benefit plan non-service income totaled $89 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $113 million in fiscal 2022, primarily reflecting an increase in interest costs, partially offset by lower amortization of losses and higher expected return on plan assets (please see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information). Interest, net for fiscal 2023 totaled $382 million, $2 million higher than fiscal 2022. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was 19.5 percent compared to 18.3 percent in fiscal 2022. The 1.2 percentage point increase was primarily driven by a change in the valuation allowance on our capital loss carryforward s in fiscal 2022, partially offset by certain favorable discrete tax items in fiscal 2023 . Our adjusted effective tax rate was 20.4 percent in fiscal 2023 compared to 20.9 percent in fiscal 2022 (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). The 0.5 percentage point decrease was primarily due to certain favorable discrete tax items in fiscal 2023. After-tax earnings from joint ventures decreased to $81 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $112 million in fiscal 2022, primarily driven by higher input costs at CPW and HDJ and lower net sales at HDJ, partially offset by favorable net price realization and mix at CPW. On a constant-currency basis, after-tax earnings from joint ventures decreased 18 percent (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).

Average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 11 million in fiscal 2023 from fiscal 2022 primarily due to share repurchases, partially offset by option exercises. RESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Our businesses are organized into four operating segments: North America Retail, International, Pet, and North America Foodservice . In fiscal 2022, we completed a new organization structure to streamline our global operations. We restated our net sales by segment and segment operating profit to reflect our new operating segments. These segment changes had no effect on previously reported consolidated net sales, operating profit, net earnings attributable to General Mills, or earnings per share.                                                                                                           19 The following tables provide the dollar amount and percentage of net sales and operating profit from each segment for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022: Fiscal Year20232022In MillionsDollarsPercent of TotalDollarsPercent of TotalNet SalesNorth America Retail$12,659.963%$11,572.061%International2,769.5143,315.717Pet2,473.3122,259.412North America Foodservice2,191.5111,845.710Total$20,094.2100%$18,992.8100%Segment Operating ProfitNorth America Retail$3,181.378%$2,699.774%International161.84232.06Pet445.511470.613North America Foodservice290.07255.57Total$4,078.6100%$3,657.8100%Segment operating profit as reviewed by our executive management excludes unallocated corporate items, net gain or loss on divestitures, and restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs that are centrally managed.

Segment operating profit increased 14 percent to $290 million in fiscal 2023, compared to $256 million in fiscal 2022, primarily driven by favorable net price realization and mix, partially offset by higher input costs and an increase in SG&A expenses. Segment operating profit increased 14 percent on a constant-currency basis in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for our use of this measure not defined by GAAP). UNALLOCATED CORPORATE ITEMS Unallocated corporate items include corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives, certain charitable contributions, restructuring initiative project-related costs, gains and losses on corporate investments, and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. These include gains and losses arising from the revaluation of certain grain inventories and gains and losses from mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments. These items affecting operating profit are centrally managed at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by executive management. Under our supply chain organization, our manufacturing, warehouse, and distribution activities are substantially integrated across our operations in order to maximize efficiency and productivity. As a result, fixed assets and depreciation and amortization expenses are neither maintained nor available by operating segment. Unallocated corporate expense totaled $1,033 million in fiscal 2023, compared to $403 million last year. We recorded a $292 million net increase in expense related to the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories in fiscal 2023, compared to a $133 million net decrease in expense last year. We recorded $84 million of net losses related to valuation adjustments and the sale of corporate investments in fiscal 2023, compared to $15 million of net losses in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2023, we recorded a $22 million net charge related to a voluntary recall on certain international Häagen-Dazs ice cream products. In addition, we recorded $6 million of integration costs primarily related to our acquisition of TNT Crust in fiscal 2023, compared to $22 million of integration costs related to our acquisition of Tyson Foods’ pet treats business in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2022, we recorded $73 million of transaction costs primarily related to the sale of our interests in Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, Liberté Marques Sàrl and the sale of our European dough businesses. In addition, we recorded a $22 million recovery related to a Brazil indirect tax item and a $13 million insurance recovery in fiscal 2022. In addition, certain compensation and benefits expenses and charitable contributions increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. IMPACT OF INFLATION We experienced broad based global input cost inflation of 13 percent in fiscal 2023 and 8 percent in fiscal 2022. We expect approximately 5 percent input cost inflation in fiscal 2024. We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through HMM, SRM, planning, and operating practices. Our market risk management practices are discussed in Item 7A of this report. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations. Over the most recent two-year period, our operations have generated $6.1 billion in cash. A substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We also use cash from operations to fund our capital expenditures, acquisitions, and debt service. We typically use a                                                                                                   24 combination of cash, notes payable, and long-term debt, and occasionally issue shares of common stock, to finance significant acquisitions. As of May 28, 2023, we had $381 million of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions. In anticipation of repatriating funds from foreign jurisdictions, we record local country withholding taxes on our international earnings, as applicable. We may repatriate our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries without such funds being subject to further U.S. income tax liability. Earnings prior to fiscal 2018 from our foreign subsidiaries remain permanently reinvested in those jurisdictions.

The $538 million decrease was primarily driven by a $326 million change in current assets and liabilities and a $250 million change in net divestitures gain. The $326 million change in current assets and liabilities was primarily driven by a $233 million change in inventories and a $257 million change in accounts payable, partially offset by a $125 million change in the timing of accounts receivable. We strive to grow core working capital at or below the rate of growth in our net sales. For fiscal 2023, core working capital net liability decreased 20 percent, compared to a net sales increase of 6 percent. The core working capital net liability decreased $84 million from a net liability of $423 million in fiscal 2022 to a net liability of $339 million in fiscal 2023. The $84 million net liability decrease was primarily due to an increase in inventories, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable in fiscal 2023.

During fiscal 2023, we completed the sale of our Helper main meals and Suddenly Salad side dishes businesses for cash proceeds of $607 million. During fiscal 2022, we acquired Tyson Foods’ pet treats business for an aggregate purchase price of $1.2 billion. During fiscal 2022, we sold our interests in Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, and Liberté Marques Sàrl for cash proceeds of $32 million, net of cash                                                                                                   25 divested, as part of the sale. We also completed the sale of our European dough businesses in fiscal 2022 for cash proceeds of $42 million. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately 4 percent of reported net sales in fiscal 2024. These expenditures will fund initiatives that are expected to fuel growth, support innovative products, and continue HMM initiatives throughout the supply chain.

We had $133 million of net debt issuances in fiscal 2023 compared to $386 million of net debt repayments in fiscal 2022. For more information on our debt issuances and payments, please refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. During fiscal 2023, we received $232 million of net proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options compared to $162 million in fiscal 2022. During fiscal 2023, we repurchased 18 million shares of our common stock for $1,404 million. During fiscal 2022, we repurchased 14 million shares of our common stock for $877 million. Dividends paid in fiscal 2023 totaled $1,288 million, or $2.16 per share. Dividends paid in fiscal 2022 totaled $1,244 million, or $2.04 per share.

We have material contractual obligations that arise in the normal course of business and we believe that cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months.    26 Certain of our long-term debt agreements, our credit facilities, and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May 28, 2023, we were in compliance with all of these covenants. We have $1,709 million of long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current, including $500 million of 3.65 percent fixed-rate notes due February 15, 2024, $400 million of floating-rate notes due October 17, 2023, €500 million of floating-rate notes due July 27, 2023, and €250 million of floating-rate notes due November 10, 2023. We believe that cash flows from operations, together with available short- and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. As of May 28, 2023, our total debt, including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges, was 80 percent in fixed-rate and 20 percent in floating-rate instruments, compared to 77 percent in fixed-rate and 23 percent in floating-rate instruments on May 29, 2022. The third-party holder of the General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) Class A Interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate to the holder’s capital account balance established in the most recent mark -to-market valuation (currently $252 million). The floating preferred return rate on GMC’s Class A Interests is the sum of three -month Term SOFR plus 186 basis points. The preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the Class A Interest holder or through a remarketing auction. We have an option to purchase the Class A Interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value, plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed make-whole amount. If we purchase these interests, any change in the third-party holder’s capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate EPS in that period. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, please see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Our critical accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations. These estimates include our accounting for revenue recognition, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans . Revenue Recognition Our revenues are reported net of variable consideration and consideration payable to our customers, including trade promotion, consumer coupon redemption, and other reductions to the transaction price, including estimated allowances for returns, unsalable product, and prompt pay discounts. Trade promotions are recorded using significant judgment of estimated participation and performance levels for offered programs at the time of sale. Differences between the estimated and actual reduction to the transaction price are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period. Our accrued trade and coupon promotion liabilities were $394 million as of May 28, 2023, and $420 million as of May 29, 2022. Because these amounts are significant, if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a significant effect on our results of operations. Valuation of Long-Lived Assets We estimate the useful lives of long -lived assets and make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flows to review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals, as appropriate. Intangible Assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Our estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. We use inputs from our long-range planning process to determine growth rates for sales and profits. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Intangible assets that are deemed to have finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years. Our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which include projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate.                                                           27 As of May 28, 2023, we had $21 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. While we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value, and that those intangibles will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital could result in material impairment losses and amortization expense. We performed our fiscal 2023 assessment of our intangible assets as of the first day of the second quarter of fiscal 2023, and we determined there was no impairment of our intangible assets as their related fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying value, except for Uncle Toby’s band intangible asset. In addition, while having significant coverage as of our fiscal 2023 assessment date, the Progresso and EPIC brand intangible assets had risk of decreasing coverage. We will continue to monitor these businesses for potential impairment. Stock-based Compensation The valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements. Annually, we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. For more information on these assumptions, please see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. The estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows: Fiscal Year202320222021Estimated fair values of stock options granted $14.16$8.77$8.03Assumptions:Risk-free interest rate3.3%1.5%0.7%Expected term8.5years8.5years8.5yearsExpected volatility20.9%20.2%19.5%Dividend yield3.1%3.4%3.3%The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant. An increase in the expected term by 1 year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would decrease the grant date fair value by less than 1 percent . If all other assumptions are held constant, a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2023 volatility assumption would increase the grant date fair value of our fiscal 2023 option awards by 5 percent. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based expense to final intrinsic values. Historical data has a significant bearing on our forward-looking assumptions. Significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then significantly impact the year-over-year comparability of stock-based compensation expense. Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating cash flow. The actual impact on future years’ cash flows will depend, in part, on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercise-date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant-date fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes. Realized windfall tax benefits and shortfall tax deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stock-based awards are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Because employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control, it is possible that significantly different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. Income Taxes We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the period of such change. For more information on income taxes, please see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Benefit, and Postemployment Benefit Plans We have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. We also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former and inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Please see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for a description of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans.                                                                         28 We recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants’ active working lives. Accordingly, we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations. Assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans, and health care cost trend rates. Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption annually for each plan; however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. Our historical investment returns (compound annual growth rates) for our United States defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets were a 5.7 percent loss in the 1-year period ended May 28, 2023 and returns of 3.4 percent, 5.9 percent, 5.5 percent, and 7.7 percent for the 5, 10, 15, and 20-year periods ended May 28, 2023. On a weighted-average basis, the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 6.70 percent for fiscal 2023, 5.85 percent for fiscal 2022, and 5.72 percent for fiscal 2021. For fiscal 2024, we increased our weighted-average expected rate of return on plan assets for our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the United States to 7.20 percent due to higher prospective long-term asset returns primarily on fixed income investments. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by $62 million for fiscal 2024. A market-related valuation basis is used to reduce year-to-year expense volatility. The market-related valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income. Discount Rates We estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense for our United States and most of our international defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans utilizing a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of May 31 for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the Aa Above Median corporate bond yield, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions. Our weighted-average discount rates were as follows: Defined Benefit Pension PlansOther Postretirement Benefit PlansPostemployment Benefit PlansEffective rate for fiscal 2024 service costs5.27%5.15%5.00%Effective rate for fiscal 2024 interest costs5.06%4.96%4.61%Obligations as of May 31, 20235.18%5.19%4.55%Effective rate for fiscal 2023 service costs4.57%4.41%3.69%Effective rate for fiscal 2023 interest costs4.03%3.80%3.35%Obligations as of May 31, 20224.39%4.36%3.62%Effective rate for fiscal 2022 service costs3.53%3.34%2.46%Effective rate for fiscal 2022 interest costs2.42%2.08%1.48%Lowering the discount rates by 100 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2024 by approximately $30 million. All obligation-related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as “all or almost all” inactive participants.         29 Health Care Cost Trend Rates We review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 6.6 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 6.6 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2023. Rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5 percent is reached in 2032 for all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans. Any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims. Once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight -line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as “all or almost all” inactive participants. Financial Statement Impact In fiscal 2023, we recorded net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income of $6 million compared to $26 million of income in fiscal 2022 and $4 million of expense in fiscal 2021. As of May 28, 2023, we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of $2 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and cumulative unrecognized actuarial net gains of $189 million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans, mainly as the result of liability increases from lower historical interest rates. These unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses because they currently exceed the corridors defined by GAAP. Actual future net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance, changes in future discount rates, changes in health care cost trend rates, and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued optional accounting guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The new standard provides expedients and exceptions to existing accounting requirements for contract modifications and hedge accounting related to transitioning from discontinued reference rates, such as LIBOR, to alternative reference rates, if certain criteria are met. The new accounting requirements can be applied through December 31, 2024. We have reviewed and modified certain contracts, where necessary, to apply a new reference rate, primarily the SOFR. The guidance has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. We will continue to review our contracts and arrangements that will be affected by a discontinued reference rate during the transition period. In September 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-04 requiring enhanced disclosures related to supplier financing programs. The ASU requires disclosure of the key terms of the program and a rollforward of the related obligation during the annual period, including the amount of obligations confirmed and obligations subsequently paid. The new disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with the exception of the rollforward requirement, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2024 for the primary requirement and the first quarter of fiscal 2025 for the rollforward requirement. Early adoption is permitted. We have historically presented the key terms of these programs and the associated obligation outstanding. We do not expect this ASU to have a material impact on our financial statements and related disclosures. NON-GAAP MEASURES We have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. We believe that these measures provide useful information to investors and include these measures in other communications to investors. For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure, an explanation of why we believe the non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors, and any additional material purposes for which our management or Board of Directors uses the non-GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable GAAP measure.                                         30 Significant Items Impacting Comparability Several measures below are presented on an adjusted basis. The adjustments are either items resulting from infrequently occurring events or items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the year-to-year assessment of operating results. The following are descriptions of significant items impacting comparability of our results. Divestitures gain, net Net divestitures gain primarily related to the sale of our Helper main meals and Suddenly Salad side dishes business in fiscal 2023. Divestitures gain related to the sale of our interests in Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, and Liberté Marques Sàrl and the sale of our European dough businesses in fiscal 2022.

Tax item Discrete tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2022 related to a release of a valuation allowance associated with our capital loss carryforwards expected to be used against future divestiture gains. CPW restructuring charges CPW restructuring charges related to previously announced restructuring actions. Organic Net Sales Growth Rates We provide organic net sales growth rates for our consolidated net sales and segment net sales. This measure is used in reporting to our Board of Directors and executive management and as a component of the measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that organic net sales growth rates provide useful information to investors because they provide transparency to underlying performance in our net sales by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as well as acquisitions, divestitures, and a 53rd week, when applicable, have on year-to-year comparability. A reconciliation of these measures to reported net sales growth rates, the relevant GAAP measures, are included in our Consolidated Results of Operations and Results of Segment Operations discussions in the MD&A above.                                                                                            31 Adjusted Operating Profit and Related Constant-currency Growth RateThis measure is used in reporting to our Board of Directors and executive management and as a component of the measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the operating profit measure we use to evaluate operating profit performance on a comparable year-to-year basis. Additionally, the measure is evaluated on a constant-currency basis by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on year-to-year comparability given the volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Our adjusted operating profit growth on a constant-currency basis is calculated as follows: Fiscal Year20232022ChangeOperating profit as reported$3,433.8$3,475.8(1)%Divestitures gain, net(444.6)(194.1)Mark-to-market effects291.9(133.1)Investment activity, net84.014.7Restructuring charges (recoveries)61.0(23.2)Product recall, net22.5-Acquisition integration costs5.922.4Project related costs2.4-Transaction costs0.472.8Non-income tax recovery-(22.0)Adjusted operating profit$3,457.3$3,213.38%Foreign currency exchange impactFlatAdjusted operating profit growth, on a constant-currency basis8%Note: Table may not foot due to rounding.

We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate earnings performance on a comparable year-to-year basis.

We are not able to reconcile these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures without unreasonable efforts because we are unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of changes in foreign                         37 currency exchange rates and commodity prices or the timing or impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and restructuring actions throughout fiscal 2024. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on our fiscal 2024 GAAP financial results. For fiscal 2024, we currently expect: foreign currency exchange rates (based on a blend of forward and forecasted rates and hedge positions) and acquisitions and divestitures completed prior to fiscal 2024 to reduce net sales growth by approximately one half of one percent; and restructuring charges to total approximately $15 million to $20 million.

       " 'item7a': 'ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices. Changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. In the normal course of business, we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions, authorized under established policies that place controls on these activities. The counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions. We establish credit limits for each counterparty. Our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments. For information on interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity price, and equity instrument risk, please see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. VALUE AT RISK The estimates in the table below are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices under normal market conditions. A Monte Carlo value-at-risk (VAR) methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures. The models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level. The VAR calculation used historical interest and foreign exchange rates, and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future. The market data were drawn from the RiskMetrics™ data set. The calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur. Further, since the hedging instrument (the derivative) inversely correlates with the underlying exposure, we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposure. The positions included in the calculations were: debt; investments; interest rate swaps; foreign exchange forwards; commodity swaps, futures, and options; and equity instruments. The calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities or equity-related positions that are offset by these market-risk-sensitive instruments. The table below presents the estimated maximum potential VAR arising from a one-day loss in fair value for our interest rate, foreign currency, commodity, and equity market-risk-sensitive instruments outstanding as of May 28, 2023.

      "ITEM 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW We are a global packaged foods company. We develop distinctive value-added food products and market them under unique brand names. We work continuously to improve our core products and to create new products that meet consumers’ evolving needs and preferences. In addition, we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer-directed marketing, innovative new products, and effective merchandising. We believe our brand-building approach is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe. Our fundamental financial goal is to generate competitively differentiated returns for our shareholders over the long term. We believe achieving that goal requires us to generate a consistent balance of net sales growth, margin expansion, cash conversion, and cash return to shareholders over time. Our long-term growth objectives are to deliver the following performance on average over time: ●2 to 3 percent annual growth in organic net sales; ●mid-single-digit annual growth in adjusted operating profit; ●mid- to high-single-digit annual growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS); ●free cash flow conversion of at least 95 percent of adjusted net earnings after tax; and ●cash return to shareholders of 80 to 90 percent of free cash flow, including an attractive dividend yield. We are executing our Accelerate strategy to drive sustainable, profitable growth and top-tier shareholder returns over the long term. The strategy focuses on four pillars to create competitive advantages and win: boldly building brands, relentlessly innovating, unleashing our scale, and being a force for good. We are prioritizing our core markets, global platforms, and local gem brands that have the best prospects for profitable growth, and we are committed to reshaping our portfolio with strategic acquisitions and divestitures to further enhance our growth profile. In fiscal 2023, we continued to successfully adapt to the dynamic operating environment and deliver strong performance. This included growth in organic net sales, adjusted operating profit, and adjusted diluted EPS that was ahead of our initial targets. We achieved each of the three priorities we established at the beginning of the year: We continued to compete effectively, including holding or growing market share in more than 50 percent of our global priority businesses for the fifth consecutive year, when adjusting for an unusual competitive dynamic in cereal in fiscal 2022 and assessing that platform on a 2-year basis. We generated organic net sales growth across each of our four operating segments, fueled by compelling brand building and innovation across our leading brands, and supported with strong levels of net price realization in response to 13 percent input cost inflation. We continued to invest for the future, including a 17 percent increase in media and advertising expense, a double-digit increase in investment in our digital and technology capability, and a strong increase in capital investment related to new growth capacity. We continued to reshape our portfolio, including closing on one acquisition and two divestitures that further improved our portfolio’s ability to generate profitable growth over the long term. Our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2023 rose 6 percent to $20,094 million. On an organic basis, net sales increased 10 percent compared to year-ago levels. Operating profit of $3,434 million was down 1 percent. Adjusted operating profit of $3,457 million increased 8 percent on a constant-currency basis. Diluted EPS of $4.31 was down 2 percent compared to fiscal 2022 results. Adjusted diluted EPS of $4.30 increased 10 percent on a constant-currency basis (See the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)). Net cash provided by operations totaled $2,779 million in fiscal 2023, representing a conversion rate of 106 percent of net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. This cash generation supported capital investments totaling $690 million, and our resulting free cash flow was $2,089 million at a conversion rate of 80 percent of adjusted net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. We returned cash to shareholders through dividends totaling $1,288 million and net share repurchases totaling $1,171 million. (See the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). A detailed review of our fiscal 2023 performance compared to fiscal 2022 appears below in the section titled “Fiscal 2023 Consolidated Results of Operations.” A detailed review of our fiscal 2022 performance compared to our fiscal 2021 performance is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 30, 2022 under the caption “Management’s Discussion and                                                        16 Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Fiscal 2022 Results of Consolidated Operations,” which is incorporated herein by reference. In fiscal 202 4, we expect to build on our positive momentum and continue to advance our Accelerate strategy. Our key priorities are to continue to compete effectively, to improve our supply chain efficiency, and to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation. We expect the largest factors impacting our performance in fiscal 2024 will be the economic health of consumers, the moderating rate of input cost inflation, and the increasing stability of the supply chain environment. We expect to drive organic net sales growth in fiscal 2024 through strong marketing, innovation, in-store support, and net price realization generated through our Strategic Revenue Management (SRM) capability, most of which will be carried over from SRM actions taken in fiscal 2023. For the full year, input cost inflation is expected to be approximately 5 percent of total cost of goods sold, driven primarily by labor inflation that continues to impact sourcing, manufacturing, and logistics costs. We expect to generate higher levels of Holistic Margin Management (HMM) cost savings compared to fiscal 2023. Based on these assumptions, our key full-year fiscal 2024 targets are summarized below: ●Organic net sales are expected to increase 3 to 4 percent. ●Adjusted operating profit is expected to increase 4 to 6 percent in constant-currency from the base of $3,457 million reported in fiscal 2023. ●Adjusted diluted EPS are expected to range between 4 to 6 percent in constant-currency from the base of $4.30 earned in fiscal 2023. ●Free cash flow conversion is expected to be at least 95 percent of adjusted after-tax earnings. See the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP. Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this report. FISCAL 2023 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In fiscal 2023, net sales increased 6 percent compared to fiscal 2022 and organic net sales increased 10 percent compared to last year. Operating profit decreased 1 percent to $3,434 million primarily driven by higher input costs, a decrease in contributions from volume growth, an unfavorable change to the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodities positions and grain inventories, and an increase in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses, including increased media and advertising expenses, partially offset by favorable net price realization and mix. Operating profit margin of 17.1 percent decreased 120 basis points. Adjusted operating profit of $3, 457 million increased 8 percent on a constant-currency basis, primarily driven by favorable net price realization and mix, partially offset by higher input costs, a decrease in contributions from volume growth and an increase in SG&A expenses, including increased media and advertising expenses. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 30 basis points to 17.2 percent. Diluted earnings per share of $4.31 decreased 2 percent compared to fiscal 2022. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.30 increased 10 percent on a constant-currency basis (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).

Cost of sales increased $958 million in fiscal 2023 to $13,548 million. The increase was primarily driven by a $1,454 million increase attributable to product rate and mix, partially offset by a $950 million decrease due to lower volume. We recorded a $292 million net increase in cost of sales related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories in fiscal 2023, compared to a net decrease of $133 million in fiscal 2022 (please see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information). In fiscal 2023, we recorded a $25 million charge related to a voluntary recall on certain international Häagen-Dazs ice cream products. We also recorded $5 million of restructuring charges and $2 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2023 compared to $3 million of restructuring charges in cost of sales in fiscal 2022 (please see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information). Gross margin increased 2 percent in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. Gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased 110 basis points to 32.6 percent compared to fiscal 2022. SG&A expenses increased $353 million to $3,500 million in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily driven by increased media and advertising expenses, unfavorable valuation adjustments and the loss on sale of certain corporate investments, an increase in certain compensation and benefits expenses, and an increase in charitable contributions in fiscal 2023. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales in fiscal 2023 increased 80 basis points compared to fiscal 2022. Divestitures gain, net totaled $445 million in fiscal 2023primarily related to the sale of our Helper main meals and Suddenly Salad side dishes business. In fiscal 2022, we recorded a $194 million divestitures gain related to the sale of our interest in Yoplait SAS, Yoplait marques SNC and Liberté Marques Sàrl and our European dough businesses (please refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report).Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs (recoveries) totaled $56 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $26 million of net recoveries in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2023, we approved restructuring actions to enhance the efficiency of our global supply chain structure and to optimize our Häagen-Dazs shops network, and as a result, we recorded $41 million of charges in fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2022, we approved restructuring actions in the International segment to drive efficiencies in manufacturing and logistics operations and recorded $12 million of charges. Please see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information.                                       18 Benefit plan non-service income totaled $89 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $113 million in fiscal 2022, primarily reflecting an increase in interest costs, partially offset by lower amortization of losses and higher expected return on plan assets (please see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information). Interest, net for fiscal 2023 totaled $382 million, $2 million higher than fiscal 2022. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was 19.5 percent compared to 18.3 percent in fiscal 2022. The 1.2 percentage point increase was primarily driven by a change in the valuation allowance on our capital loss carryforward s in fiscal 2022, partially offset by certain favorable discrete tax items in fiscal 2023 . Our adjusted effective tax rate was 20.4 percent in fiscal 2023 compared to 20.9 percent in fiscal 2022 (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). The 0.5 percentage point decrease was primarily due to certain favorable discrete tax items in fiscal 2023. After-tax earnings from joint ventures decreased to $81 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $112 million in fiscal 2022, primarily driven by higher input costs at CPW and HDJ and lower net sales at HDJ, partially offset by favorable net price realization and mix at CPW. On a constant-currency basis, after-tax earnings from joint ventures decreased 18 percent (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).

Average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 11 million in fiscal 2023 from fiscal 2022 primarily due to share repurchases, partially offset by option exercises. RESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Our businesses are organized into four operating segments: North America Retail, International, Pet, and North America Foodservice . In fiscal 2022, we completed a new organization structure to streamline our global operations. We restated our net sales by segment and segment operating profit to reflect our new operating segments. These segment changes had no effect on previously reported consolidated net sales, operating profit, net earnings attributable to General Mills, or earnings per share.                                                                                                           19 The following tables provide the dollar amount and percentage of net sales and operating profit from each segment for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022: Fiscal Year20232022In MillionsDollarsPercent of TotalDollarsPercent of TotalNet SalesNorth America Retail$12,659.963%$11,572.061%International2,769.5143,315.717Pet2,473.3122,259.412North America Foodservice2,191.5111,845.710Total$20,094.2100%$18,992.8100%Segment Operating ProfitNorth America Retail$3,181.378%$2,699.774%International161.84232.06Pet445.511470.613North America Foodservice290.07255.57Total$4,078.6100%$3,657.8100%Segment operating profit as reviewed by our executive management excludes unallocated corporate items, net gain or loss on divestitures, and restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs that are centrally managed.

Segment operating profit decreased 25 percent on a constant-currency basis in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for our use of this measure not defined by GAAP). PET SEGMENT Our Pet operating segment includes pet food products sold primarily in the United States and Canada in national pet superstore chains, e-commerce retailers, grocery stores, regional pet store chains, mass merchandisers, and veterinary clinics and hospitals. Our product categories include dog and cat food (dry foods, wet foods, and treats) made with whole meats, fruits, and vegetables and other high-quality natural ingredients. Our tailored pet product offerings address specific dietary, lifestyle, and life-stage needs and span different product types, diet types, breed sizes for dogs, lifestages, flavors, product functions, and textures and cuts for wet foods.

NORTH AMERICA FOODSERVICE SEGMENT Our major product categories in our North America Foodservice operating segment are ready-to-eat cereals, snacks, refrigerated yogurt, frozen meals, unbaked and fully baked frozen dough products, baking mixes, and bakery flour. Many products we sell are branded to the consumer and nearly all are branded to our customers. We sell to distributors and operators in many customer channels including foodservice, vending, and supermarket bakeries.

The 13 percent increase in North America Foodservice organic net sales growth in fiscal 2023 was driven by favorable organic net price realization and mix, including market index pricing on bakery flour, partially offset by a decrease in contributions from organic volume growth. Segment operating profit increased 14 percent to $290 million in fiscal 2023, compared to $256 million in fiscal 2022, primarily driven by favorable net price realization and mix, partially offset by higher input costs and an increase in SG&A expenses. Segment operating profit increased 14 percent on a constant-currency basis in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for our use of this measure not defined by GAAP). UNALLOCATED CORPORATE ITEMS Unallocated corporate items include corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives, certain charitable contributions, restructuring initiative project-related costs, gains and losses on corporate investments, and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. These include gains and losses arising from the revaluation of certain grain inventories and gains and losses from mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments. These items affecting operating profit are centrally managed at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by executive management. Under our supply chain organization, our manufacturing, warehouse, and distribution activities are substantially integrated across our operations in order to maximize efficiency and productivity. As a result, fixed assets and depreciation and amortization expenses are neither maintained nor available by operating segment. Unallocated corporate expense totaled $1,033 million in fiscal 2023, compared to $403 million last year. We recorded a $292 million net increase in expense related to the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories in fiscal 2023, compared to a $133 million net decrease in expense last year. We recorded $84 million of net losses related to valuation adjustments and the sale of corporate investments in fiscal 2023, compared to $15 million of net losses in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2023, we recorded a $22 million net charge related to a voluntary recall on certain international Häagen-Dazs ice cream products. In addition, we recorded $6 million of integration costs primarily related to our acquisition of TNT Crust in fiscal 2023, compared to $22 million of integration costs related to our acquisition of Tyson Foods’ pet treats business in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2022, we recorded $73 million of transaction costs primarily related to the sale of our interests in Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, Liberté Marques Sàrl and the sale of our European dough businesses. In addition, we recorded a $22 million recovery related to a Brazil indirect tax item and a $13 million insurance recovery in fiscal 2022. In addition, certain compensation and benefits expenses and charitable contributions increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. IMPACT OF INFLATION We experienced broad based global input cost inflation of 13 percent in fiscal 2023 and 8 percent in fiscal 2022. We expect approximately 5 percent input cost inflation in fiscal 2024. We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through HMM, SRM, planning, and operating practices. Our market risk management practices are discussed in Item 7A of this report. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations. Over the most recent two-year period, our operations have generated $6.1 billion in cash. A substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We also use cash from operations to fund our capital expenditures, acquisitions, and debt service. We typically use a                                                                                                   24 combination of cash, notes payable, and long-term debt, and occasionally issue shares of common stock, to finance significant acquisitions. As of May 28, 2023, we had $381 million of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions. In anticipation of repatriating funds from foreign jurisdictions, we record local country withholding taxes on our international earnings, as applicable. We may repatriate our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries without such funds being subject to further U.S. income tax liability. Earnings prior to fiscal 2018 from our foreign subsidiaries remain permanently reinvested in those jurisdictions.

The $538 million decrease was primarily driven by a $326 million change in current assets and liabilities and a $250 million change in net divestitures gain. The $326 million change in current assets and liabilities was primarily driven by a $233 million change in inventories and a $257 million change in accounts payable, partially offset by a $125 million change in the timing of accounts receivable. We strive to grow core working capital at or below the rate of growth in our net sales. For fiscal 2023, core working capital net liability decreased 20 percent, compared to a net sales increase of 6 percent. The core working capital net liability decreased $84 million from a net liability of $423 million in fiscal 2022 to a net liability of $339 million in fiscal 2023. The $84 million net liability decrease was primarily due to an increase in inventories, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable in fiscal 2023.

During fiscal 2023, we acquired TNT Crust for $252 million cash, net of cash acquired. During fiscal 2023, we completed the sale of our Helper main meals and Suddenly Salad side dishes businesses for cash proceeds of $607 million. During fiscal 2022, we acquired Tyson Foods’ pet treats business for an aggregate purchase price of $1.2 billion. During fiscal 2022, we sold our interests in Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, and Liberté Marques Sàrl for cash proceeds of $32 million, net of cash                                                                                                   25 divested, as part of the sale. We also completed the sale of our European dough businesses in fiscal 2022 for cash proceeds of $42 million. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately 4 percent of reported net sales in fiscal 2024. These expenditures will fund initiatives that are expected to fuel growth, support innovative products, and continue HMM initiatives throughout the supply chain.

For more information on our debt issuances and payments, please refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. During fiscal 2023, we received $232 million of net proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options compared to $162 million in fiscal 2022. During fiscal 2023, we repurchased 18 million shares of our common stock for $1,404 million. During fiscal 2022, we repurchased 14 million shares of our common stock for $877 million. Dividends paid in fiscal 2023 totaled $1,288 million, or $2.16 per share. Dividends paid in fiscal 2022 totaled $1,244 million, or $2.04 per share.

We have material contractual obligations that arise in the normal course of business and we believe that cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months.    26 Certain of our long-term debt agreements, our credit facilities, and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May 28, 2023, we were in compliance with all of these covenants. We have $1,709 million of long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current, including $500 million of 3.65 percent fixed-rate notes due February 15, 2024, $400 million of floating-rate notes due October 17, 2023, €500 million of floating-rate notes due July 27, 2023, and €250 million of floating-rate notes due November 10, 2023. We believe that cash flows from operations, together with available short- and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. As of May 28, 2023, our total debt, including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges, was 80 percent in fixed-rate and 20 percent in floating-rate instruments, compared to 77 percent in fixed-rate and 23 percent in floating-rate instruments on May 29, 2022. The third-party holder of the General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) Class A Interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate to the holder’s capital account balance established in the most recent mark -to-market valuation (currently $252 million). The floating preferred return rate on GMC’s Class A Interests is the sum of three -month Term SOFR plus 186 basis points. The preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the Class A Interest holder or through a remarketing auction. We have an option to purchase the Class A Interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value, plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed make-whole amount. If we purchase these interests, any change in the third-party holder’s capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate EPS in that period. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, please see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Our critical accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations. These estimates include our accounting for revenue recognition, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans . Revenue Recognition Our revenues are reported net of variable consideration and consideration payable to our customers, including trade promotion, consumer coupon redemption, and other reductions to the transaction price, including estimated allowances for returns, unsalable product, and prompt pay discounts. Trade promotions are recorded using significant judgment of estimated participation and performance levels for offered programs at the time of sale. Differences between the estimated and actual reduction to the transaction price are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period. Our accrued trade and coupon promotion liabilities were $394 million as of May 28, 2023, and $420 million as of May 29, 2022. Because these amounts are significant, if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a significant effect on our results of operations. Valuation of Long-Lived Assets We estimate the useful lives of long -lived assets and make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flows to review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals, as appropriate. Intangible Assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Our estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. We use inputs from our long-range planning process to determine growth rates for sales and profits. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Intangible assets that are deemed to have finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years. Our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which include projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate.                                                           27 As of May 28, 2023, we had $21 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. While we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value, and that those intangibles will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital could result in material impairment losses and amortization expense. We performed our fiscal 2023 assessment of our intangible assets as of the first day of the second quarter of fiscal 2023, and we determined there was no impairment of our intangible assets as their related fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying value, except for Uncle Toby’s band intangible asset. In addition, while having significant coverage as of our fiscal 2023 assessment date, the Progresso and EPIC brand intangible assets had risk of decreasing coverage. We will continue to monitor these businesses for potential impairment. Stock-based Compensation The valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements. Annually, we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. For more information on these assumptions, please see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. The estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows: Fiscal Year202320222021Estimated fair values of stock options granted $14.16$8.77$8.03Assumptions:Risk-free interest rate3.3%1.5%0.7%Expected term8.5years8.5years8.5yearsExpected volatility20.9%20.2%19.5%Dividend yield3.1%3.4%3.3%The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant. An increase in the expected term by 1 year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would decrease the grant date fair value by less than 1 percent . If all other assumptions are held constant, a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2023 volatility assumption would increase the grant date fair value of our fiscal 2023 option awards by 5 percent. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based expense to final intrinsic values. Historical data has a significant bearing on our forward-looking assumptions. Significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then significantly impact the year-over-year comparability of stock-based compensation expense. Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating cash flow. The actual impact on future years’ cash flows will depend, in part, on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercise-date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant-date fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes. Realized windfall tax benefits and shortfall tax deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stock-based awards are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Because employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control, it is possible that significantly different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. Income Taxes We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the period of such change. For more information on income taxes, please see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Benefit, and Postemployment Benefit Plans We have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. We also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former and inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Please see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for a description of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans.                                                                         28 We recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants’ active working lives. Accordingly, we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations. Assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans, and health care cost trend rates. Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption annually for each plan; however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. Our historical investment returns (compound annual growth rates) for our United States defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets were a 5.7 percent loss in the 1-year period ended May 28, 2023 and returns of 3.4 percent, 5.9 percent, 5.5 percent, and 7.7 percent for the 5, 10, 15, and 20-year periods ended May 28, 2023. On a weighted-average basis, the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 6.70 percent for fiscal 2023, 5.85 percent for fiscal 2022, and 5.72 percent for fiscal 2021. For fiscal 2024, we increased our weighted-average expected rate of return on plan assets for our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the United States to 7.20 percent due to higher prospective long-term asset returns primarily on fixed income investments. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by $62 million for fiscal 2024. A market-related valuation basis is used to reduce year-to-year expense volatility. The market-related valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income. Discount Rates We estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense for our United States and most of our international defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans utilizing a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of May 31 for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the Aa Above Median corporate bond yield, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions. Our weighted-average discount rates were as follows: Defined Benefit Pension PlansOther Postretirement Benefit PlansPostemployment Benefit PlansEffective rate for fiscal 2024 service costs5.27%5.15%5.00%Effective rate for fiscal 2024 interest costs5.06%4.96%4.61%Obligations as of May 31, 20235.18%5.19%4.55%Effective rate for fiscal 2023 service costs4.57%4.41%3.69%Effective rate for fiscal 2023 interest costs4.03%3.80%3.35%Obligations as of May 31, 20224.39%4.36%3.62%Effective rate for fiscal 2022 service costs3.53%3.34%2.46%Effective rate for fiscal 2022 interest costs2.42%2.08%1.48%Lowering the discount rates by 100 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2024 by approximately $30 million. All obligation-related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as “all or almost all” inactive participants.         29 Health Care Cost Trend Rates We review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 6.6 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 6.6 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2023. Rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5 percent is reached in 2032 for all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans. Any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims. Once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight -line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as “all or almost all” inactive participants. Financial Statement Impact In fiscal 2023, we recorded net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income of $6 million compared to $26 million of income in fiscal 2022 and $4 million of expense in fiscal 2021. As of May 28, 2023, we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of $2 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and cumulative unrecognized actuarial net gains of $189 million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans, mainly as the result of liability increases from lower historical interest rates. These unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses because they currently exceed the corridors defined by GAAP. Actual future net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance, changes in future discount rates, changes in health care cost trend rates, and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued optional accounting guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The new standard provides expedients and exceptions to existing accounting requirements for contract modifications and hedge accounting related to transitioning from discontinued reference rates, such as LIBOR, to alternative reference rates, if certain criteria are met. The new accounting requirements can be applied through December 31, 2024. We have reviewed and modified certain contracts, where necessary, to apply a new reference rate, primarily the SOFR. The guidance has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. We will continue to review our contracts and arrangements that will be affected by a discontinued reference rate during the transition period. In September 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-04 requiring enhanced disclosures related to supplier financing programs. The ASU requires disclosure of the key terms of the program and a rollforward of the related obligation during the annual period, including the amount of obligations confirmed and obligations subsequently paid. The new disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with the exception of the rollforward requirement, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2024 for the primary requirement and the first quarter of fiscal 2025 for the rollforward requirement. Early adoption is permitted. We have historically presented the key terms of these programs and the associated obligation outstanding. We do not expect this ASU to have a material impact on our financial statements and related disclosures. NON-GAAP MEASURES We have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. We believe that these measures provide useful information to investors and include these measures in other communications to investors. For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure, an explanation of why we believe the non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors, and any additional material purposes for which our management or Board of Directors uses the non-GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable GAAP measure.                                         30 Significant Items Impacting Comparability Several measures below are presented on an adjusted basis. The adjustments are either items resulting from infrequently occurring events or items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the year-to-year assessment of operating results. The following are descriptions of significant items impacting comparability of our results. Divestitures gain, net Net divestitures gain primarily related to the sale of our Helper main meals and Suddenly Salad side dishes business in fiscal 2023. Divestitures gain related to the sale of our interests in Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, and Liberté Marques Sàrl and the sale of our European dough businesses in fiscal 2022.

Tax item Discrete tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2022 related to a release of a valuation allowance associated with our capital loss carryforwards expected to be used against future divestiture gains. CPW restructuring charges CPW restructuring charges related to previously announced restructuring actions. Organic Net Sales Growth Rates We provide organic net sales growth rates for our consolidated net sales and segment net sales. This measure is used in reporting to our Board of Directors and executive management and as a component of the measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that organic net sales growth rates provide useful information to investors because they provide transparency to underlying performance in our net sales by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as well as acquisitions, divestitures, and a 53rd week, when applicable, have on year-to-year comparability. A reconciliation of these measures to reported net sales growth rates, the relevant GAAP measures, are included in our Consolidated Results of Operations and Results of Segment Operations discussions in the MD&A above.                                                                                            31 Adjusted Operating Profit and Related Constant-currency Growth RateThis measure is used in reporting to our Board of Directors and executive management and as a component of the measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the operating profit measure we use to evaluate operating profit performance on a comparable year-to-year basis. Additionally, the measure is evaluated on a constant-currency basis by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on year-to-year comparability given the volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Our adjusted operating profit growth on a constant-currency basis is calculated as follows: Fiscal Year20232022ChangeOperating profit as reported$3,433.8$3,475.8(1)%Divestitures gain, net(444.6)(194.1)Mark-to-market effects291.9(133.1)Investment activity, net84.014.7Restructuring charges (recoveries)61.0(23.2)Product recall, net22.5-Acquisition integration costs5.922.4Project related costs2.4-Transaction costs0.472.8Non-income tax recovery-(22.0)Adjusted operating profit$3,457.3$3,213.38%Foreign currency exchange impactFlatAdjusted operating profit growth, on a constant-currency basis8%Note: Table may not foot due to rounding.

We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate earnings performance on a comparable year-to-year basis. The reconciliation of our GAAP measure, diluted EPS, to adjusted diluted EPS and the related constant-currency growth rate follows: Fiscal YearPer Share Data202320222023 vs. 2022 ChangeDiluted earnings per share, as reported$4.31$4.42(2)%Divestitures gain, net(0.62)(0.31)Mark-to-market effects0.37(0.17)Investment activity, net0.110.01Restructuring charges (recoveries)0.08(0.03)Product recall, net0.03-Acquisition integration costs0.010.03Transaction costs-0.09Non-income tax recovery-(0.02)Tax item-(0.08)Adjusted diluted earnings per share$4.30$3.949%Foreign currency exchange impact(1)ptAdjusted diluted earnings per share growth, on a constant-currency basis10%Note: Table may not foot due to rounding.

After-tax earnings from joint ventures growth rate on a constant-currency basis are calculated as follows: Fiscal 2023Percentage change in after-tax earnings from joint ventures as reported(27)%Impact of foreign currency exchange(10)ptsPercentage change in after-tax earnings from joint ventures on a constant-currency basis(18)%Note: Table may not foot due to rounding.Net Sales Growth Rate for Canada Operating Unit on a Constant-currency Basis We believe this measure of our Canada operating unit net sales provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to the underlying performance for the Canada operating unit within our North America Retail segment by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on year-to-year comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets. Net sales growth rate for our Canada operating unit on a constant-currency basis is calculated as follows: Fiscal 2023Percentage change in net sales as reported2%Impact of foreign currency exchange(6)ptsPercentage change in net sales on a constant-currency basis8%Note: Table may not foot due to rounding.Constant-currency Segment Operating Profit Growth Rates We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to underlying performance of our segments by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on year-to-year comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets. Our segments’ operating profit growth rates on a constant-currency basis are calculated as follows: Fiscal 2023Percentage Change in Operating Profit as ReportedImpact of Foreign Currency ExchangePercentage Change in Operating Profit on Constant-Currency BasisNorth America Retail18%Flat18%International(30)%(5)pts(25)%Pet(5)%Flat(5)%North America Foodservice14%Flat14%Note: Table may not foot due to rounding.Forward-Looking Financial Measures Our fiscal 202 4 outlook for organic net sales growth, constant-currency adjusted operating profit, adjusted diluted EPS, and free cash flow conversion are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude, or have otherwise been adjusted for, items impacting comparability, including the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, restructuring charges and project-related costs, acquisition transaction and integration costs, acquisitions, divestitures, and mark-to-market effects. We are not able to reconcile these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures without unreasonable efforts because we are unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of changes in foreign                         37 currency exchange rates and commodity prices or the timing or impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and restructuring actions throughout fiscal 2024. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on our fiscal 2024 GAAP financial results. For fiscal 2024, we currently expect: foreign currency exchange rates (based on a blend of forward and forecasted rates and hedge positions) and acquisitions and divestitures completed prior to fiscal 2024 to reduce net sales growth by approximately one half of one percent; and restructuring charges to total approximately $15 million to $20 million. \n"
